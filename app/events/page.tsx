        <p>
          We dream of opening our doors to a series of events that celebrate the
          art of woodcrafting. Picture evenings of camaraderie around crafted
          tables, where the scent of fresh timber blends with laughter and
          storytelling. Our envisioned events include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Local Artisan Showcases</li>
          <li>Live Craft Demonstrations</li>
          <li>Community Build Projects</li>
          <li>Seasonal Craft Fairs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="regular-32">Stay Updated</h2>

        <p>
